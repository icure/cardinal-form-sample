/**
 * Ckmeans clustering is an improvement on heuristic-based clustering
 * approaches like Jenks. The algorithm was developed in
 * [Haizhou Wang and Mingzhou Song](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-2/RJournal_2011-2_Wang+Song.pdf)
 * as a [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) approach
 * to the problem of clustering numeric data into groups with the least
 * within-group sum-of-squared-deviations.
 *
 * Minimizing the difference within groups - what Wang & Song refer to as
 * `withinss`, or within sum-of-squares, means that groups are optimally
 * homogenous within and the data is split into representative groups.
 * This is very useful for visualization, where you may want to represent
 * a continuous variable in discrete color or style groups. This function
 * can provide groups that emphasize differences between data.
 *
 * Being a dynamic approach, this algorithm is based on two matrices that
 * store incrementally-computed values for squared deviations and backtracking
 * indexes.
 *
 * This implementation is based on Ckmeans 3.4.6, which introduced a new divide
 * and conquer approach that improved runtime from O(kn^2) to O(kn log(n)).
 *
 * Unlike the [original implementation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ckmeans.1d.dp/index.html),
 * this implementation does not include any code to automatically determine
 * the optimal number of clusters: this information needs to be explicitly
 * provided.
